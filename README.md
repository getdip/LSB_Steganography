This is a project written in C programming language. 

Plain simple text hidden within an image.

# Project Overview

An image and a secret text are provided as an input to the application. The application encodes the secret text (secret.txt) within the image file (beautiful.bmp) and an encoded image file is produced(stego_image.bmp). Once encoding is completed the encoded image file (stego_image.bmp) is then decoded to get the secret text (Output.txt).
